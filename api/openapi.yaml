          the application you're working with. In the OAuth 2.0 Parameters section
          of the configuration page, find the item labelled `client_id`. The
          text of that item is your application's Client ID.

          The URI to which Box redirects the browser after the user has granted
          or denied the application permission. This URI match one of the redirect
          URIs in the configuration of your application. It must be a
          valid HTTPS URI and it needs to be able to handle the redirection to
          complete the next step in the OAuth 2.0 flow.
          Although this parameter is optional, it must be a part of the
          authorization URL if you configured multiple redirect URIs
          for the application in the developer console. A missing parameter causes
          a `redirect_uri_missing` error after the user grants application access.

          against hijacked sessions and other exploits.

          A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the

          not normally returned in a standard response.

          Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
          effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
          the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
          fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
          to the fields requested.

          Additionally this field can be used to query any metadata
          applied to the file by specifying the `metadata` field as well
          as the scope and key of the template to retrieve, for example
          `?field=metadata.enterprise_12345.contractTemplate`.

          This header can be used to access items that have not been

          Use the format `shared_link=[link]` or if a password is required then
          use `shared_link=[link]&shared_link_password=[password]`.

          This header can be used on the file or folder shared, as well as on any files
          or folders nested within the item.

          A header required to request specific `representations`
          of a file. Use this in combination with the `fields` query
          parameter to request a specific file representation.

          The general format for these representations is
          `X-Rep-Hints: [...]` where `[...]` is one or many
          hints in the format `[fileType?query]`.

          For example, to request a `png` representation in `32x32`
          as well as `64x64` pixel dimensions provide the following
          hints.

          `x-rep-hints: [jpg?dimensions=32x32][jpg?dimensions=64x64]`

          Additionally, a `text` representation is available for all
          document file types in Box using the `[extracted_text]`
          representation.

          `x-rep-hints: [extracted_text]`

          One exception is the last part of the file, as this can be smaller.

          When providing the value for `content-range`, remember that:

        Retrieves details for a folder, including the first 100 entries
        in the folder.

        Passing `sort`, `direction`, `offset`, and `limit`
        parameters in query allows you to manage the
        list of returned
        [folder items](r://folder--full#param-item-collection).

        To fetch more items within the folder, use the
        [Get items in a folder](e://get-folders-id-items) endpoint.

      parameters:
      - description: |-
          The unique identifier that represent a folder.

          The ID for any folder can be determined
          by visiting this folder in the web application
          and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
          for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/folder/123`
          the `folder_id` is `123`.

          The root folder of a Box account is
          always represented by the ID `0`.
        example: "12345"
        explode: false
        in: path
        name: folder_id
        required: true
        schema:

          A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
          response. This can be used to request fields that are
          not normally returned in a standard response.

          Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
          effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
          the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
          fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
          to the fields requested.

          Additionally this field can be used to query any metadata
          applied to the file by specifying the `metadata` field as well
          as the scope and key of the template to retrieve, for example
          `?field=metadata.enterprise_12345.contractTemplate`.
        example:
        - id

          The URL, and optional password, for the shared link of this item.

          This header can be used to access items that have not been

          Use the format `shared_link=[link]` or if a password is required then
          use `shared_link=[link]&shared_link_password=[password]`.

          This header can be used on the file or folder shared, as well as on any files
          or folders nested within the item.

          Defines the **second** attribute by which items
          are sorted.

          The folder type affects the way the items
          are sorted:

            * **Standard folder**:
            Items are always sorted by
            their `type` first, with
            folders listed before files,
            and files listed
            before web links.

            * **Root folder**:
            This parameter is not supported
            for marker-based pagination
            on the root folder

            (the folder with an `id` of `0`).

            * **Shared folder with parent path
            to the associated folder visible to
            the collaborator**:
            Items are always sorted by
            their `type` first, with
            folders listed before files,
            and files listed
            before web links.

        To request more information about the folder itself, like its size,
        use the [Get a folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) endpoint instead.

          The unique identifier that represent a folder.

          The ID for any folder can be determined
          by visiting this folder in the web application
          and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
          for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/folder/123`
          the `folder_id` is `123`.

          The root folder of a Box account is
          always represented by the ID `0`.
        example: "12345"
        explode: false

          A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
          response. This can be used to request fields that are
          not normally returned in a standard response.

          Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
          effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
          the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
          fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
          to the fields requested.

          Additionally this field can be used to query any metadata
          applied to the file by specifying the `metadata` field as well
          as the scope and key of the template to retrieve, for example
          `?field=metadata.enterprise_12345.contractTemplate`.
        example:

          Specifies whether to use marker-based pagination instead of
          offset-based pagination. Only one pagination method can
          be used at a time.

          By setting this value to true, the API will return a `marker` field
          that can be passed as a parameter to this endpoint to get the next
          page of the response.
        example: true
        explode: true

          Use the format `shared_link=[link]` or if a password is required then

          Defines the **second** attribute by which items
          are sorted.

          The folder type affects the way the items
          are sorted:

            * **Standard folder**:
            Items are always sorted by
            their `type` first, with
            folders listed before files,
            and files listed
            before web links.

            * **Root folder**:
            This parameter is not supported
            for marker-based pagination
            on the root folder

            (the folder with an `id` of `0`).

            * **Shared folder with parent path
            to the associated folder visible to
            the collaborator**:
            Items are always sorted by

            folders listed before files,
            and files listed

        Retrieves the files and folders that have been moved

        Any attribute in the full files or folders objects can be passed
        in with the `fields` parameter to retrieve those specific
        attributes that are not returned by default.

        This endpoint defaults to use offset-based pagination, yet also supports
        marker-based pagination using the `marker` parameter.
      operationId: TrashedItems_listRetrievedItems
      parameters:
      - description: |-
          A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
          response. This can be used to request fields that are
          not normally returned in a standard response.

          Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
          effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
          the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
          fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
          to the fields requested.

          Specifies whether to use marker-based pagination instead of
          offset-based pagination. Only one pagination method can
          be used at a time.

          By setting this value to true, the API will return a `marker` field
          that can be passed as a parameter to this endpoint to get the next
          page of the response.
        example: true

          The direction to sort results in. This can be either in alphabetical ascending

        x-konfig-original-example: ASC
      - description: |-
          Defines the **second** attribute by which items

          Items are always sorted by their `type` first, with

        Searches for files, folders, web links, and shared files across the
        users content or across the entire enterprise.
      operationId: get_search
      parameters:
      - description: |-
          The string to search for. This query is matched against item names,
          descriptions, text content of files, and various other fields of
          the different item types.

          This parameter supports a variety of operators to further refine
          the results returns.

          * `""` - by wrapping a query in double quotes only exact matches are
            returned by the API. Exact searches do not return search matches
            based on specific character sequences. Instead, they return
            matches based on phrases, that is, word sequences. For example:
            A search for `"Blue-Box"` may return search results including
            the sequence `"blue.box"`, `"Blue Box"`, and `"Blue-Box"`;
            any item containing the words `Blue` and `Box` consecutively, in
            the order specified.
          * `AND` - returns items that contain both the search terms. For
            example, a search for `marketing AND BoxWorks` returns items
            that have both `marketing` and `BoxWorks` within its text in any order.
            It does not return a result that only has `BoxWorks` in its text.
          * `OR` - returns items that contain either of the search terms. For
            example, a search for `marketing OR BoxWorks` returns a result that
            has either `marketing` or `BoxWorks` within its text. Using this
            operator is not necessary as we implicitly interpret multi-word
            queries as `OR` unless another supported boolean term is used.
          * `NOT` - returns items that do not contain the search term provided.
            For example, a search for `marketing AND NOT BoxWorks` returns a result
            that has only `marketing` within its text. Results containing
            `BoxWorks` are omitted.

          We do not support lower case (that is,
          `and`, `or`, and `not`) or mixed case (that is, `And`, `Or`, and `Not`)
          operators.

          This field is required unless the `mdfilters` parameter is defined.
        example: sales
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: query

          Limits the search results to either the files that the user has
          access to, or to files available to the entire enterprise.

          The scope defaults to `user_content`, which limits the search
          results to content that is available to the currently authenticated
          user.

          The `enterprise_content` can be requested by an admin through our
          support channels. Once this scope has been enabled for a user, it
          will allow that use to query for content across the entire
          enterprise and not only the content that they have access to.

          Size ranges are defined as comma separated list of a lower
          and upper byte size limit (inclusive).

          The upper and lower bound can be omitted to create open ranges.

          Limits the search results to any items that are owned
          by the given list of owners, defined as a list of comma separated
          user IDs.

          The items still need to be owned or shared with
          the currently authenticated user for them to show up in the search
          results. If the user does not have access to any files owned by any of
          the users an empty result set will be returned.

          To search across an entire enterprise, we recommend using the
          `enterprise_content` scope parameter which can be requested with our
          support team.
        example:
        - "123422"

          Limits the search results to any items that have been updated

          The items still need to be owned or shared with

          results. If the user does not have access to any files owned by any of
          the users an empty result set will be returned.

          This feature only searches back to the last 10 versions of an item.
        example:
        - "123422"

          Limits the search results to items within the given
          list of folders, defined as a comma separated lists
          of folder IDs.

          Search results will also include items within any subfolders
          of those ancestor folders.

          The folders still need to be owned or shared with
          the currently authenticated user. If the folder is not accessible by this
          user, or it does not exist, a `HTTP 404` error code will be returned
          instead.

          To search across an entire enterprise, we recommend using the
          `enterprise_content` scope parameter which can be requested with our
          support team.
        example:
        - "4535234"

          Limits the search results to any items that match the search query
          for a specific part of the file, for example the file description.

          Content types are defined as a comma separated lists
          of Box recognized content types. The allowed content types are as follows.

          * `name` - The name of the item, as defined by its `name` field.
          * `description` - The description of the item, as defined by its
            `description` field.
          * `file_content` - The actual content of the file.
          * `comments` - The content of any of the comments on a file or
             folder.
          * `tags` - Any tags that are applied to an item, as defined by its
             `tags` field.

          Limits the search results to any items of this type. This
          parameter only takes one value. By default the API returns
          items that match any of these types.

          * `file` - Limits the search results to files
          * `folder` - Limits the search results to folders

          Determines if the search should look in the trash for items.

          By default, this API only returns search results for items
          not currently in the trash (`non_trashed_only`).

          * `trashed_only` - Only searches for items currently in the trash
          * `non_trashed_only` - Only searches for items currently not in
            the trash
          * `all_items` - Searches for both trashed and non-trashed items.

          Defines the order in which search results are returned. This API
          defaults to returning items by relevance unless this parameter is
          explicitly specified.

          * `relevance` (default) returns the results sorted by relevance to the

          Limits the search results to items that were deleted by the given
          list of users, defined as a list of comma separated user IDs.

          The `trash_content` parameter needs to be set to `trashed_only`.

          If searching in trash is not performed, an empty result set
          is returned. The items need to be owned or shared with
          the currently authenticated user for them to show up in the search
          results.

          If the user does not have access to any files owned by
          any of the users, an empty result set is returned.

        Returns the file represented by a shared link.

        A shared file can be represented by a shared link,
        which can originate within the current enterprise or within another.

        This endpoint allows an application to retrieve information about a
        shared file when only given a shared link.

        The `shared_link_permission_options` array field can be returned
        by requesting it in the `fields` query parameter.
      operationId: SharedLinksFiles_getBySharedLink
      parameters:
      - description: |-
          Ensures an item is only returned if it has changed.

          Pass in the item's last observed `etag` value
          into this header and the endpoint will fail
          with a `304 Not Modified` if the item has not
          changed since.
        example: "1"
        explode: false

          A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
          response. This can be used to request fields that are
          not normally returned in a standard response.

          Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
          effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
          the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
          fields for the mini representation are returned, additional

          Pass in the item's last observed `etag` value

        The application and the authenticated user need to

          Limits the results to only users who's `name` or

          For externally managed users, the search term needs
          to completely match the in order to find the user, and
          it will only return one user at a time.
        example: john

          * `all` returns every kind of user for whom the
            `login` or `name` partially matches the
            `filter_term`. It will only return an external user
            if the login matches the `filter_term` completely,
            and in that case it will only return that user.
          * `managed` returns all managed and app users for whom
            the `login` or `name` partially matches the
            `filter_term`.
          * `external` returns all external users for whom the
            `login` matches the `filter_term` exactly.

        Move all of the items (files, folders and workflows) owned by a user into
        another user's account

        Only the root folder (`0`) can be transferred.

        Folders can only be moved across users by users with administrative
        permissions.

        All existing shared links and folder-level collaborations are transferred
        during the operation. Please note that while collaborations at the individual
        file-level are transferred during the operation, the collaborations are
        deleted when the original user is deleted.

        This call will be performed synchronously which might lead to a slow response
        when the source user has a large number of items in all of its folders.

        If the destination path has a metadata cascade policy attached to any of
        the parent folders, a metadata cascade operation will be kicked off
        asynchronously.

        There is currently no way to check for when this operation is finished.

        The destination folder's name will be in the format `{User}'s Files and
        Folders`, where `{User}` is the display name of the user.

        To make this API call your application will need to have the "Read and write
        all files and folders stored in Box" scope enabled.

        Please make sure the destination user has access to `Relay` or `Relay Lite`,
        and has access to the files and folders involved in the workflows being
        transferred.

        Admins will receive an email when the operation is completed.

          Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
          effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
          the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
          fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
          to the fields requested.

        Returns up to a year of past events for a given user

        By default this returns events for the authenticated user. To retrieve events
        for the entire enterprise, set the `stream_type` to `admin_logs_streaming`
        for live monitoring of new events, or `admin_logs` for querying across
        historical events. The user making the API call will
        need to have admin privileges, and the application will need to have the
        scope `manage enterprise properties` checked.
      operationId: get_events
      parameters:
      - description: |-
          Defines the type of events that are returned

          * `all` returns everything for a user and is the default
          * `changes` returns events that may cause file tree changes
            such as file updates or collaborations.
          * `sync` is similar to `changes` but only applies to synced folders
          * `admin_logs` returns all events for an entire enterprise and
            requires the user making the API call to have admin permissions. This
            stream type is for programmatically pulling from a 1 year history of
            events across all users within the enterprise and within a
            `created_after` and `created_before` time frame. The complete history
            of events will be returned in chronological order based on the event
            time, but latency will be much higher than `admin_logs_streaming`.
          * `admin_logs_streaming` returns all events for an entire enterprise and
            requires the user making the API call to have admin permissions. This
            stream type is for polling for recent events across all users within
            the enterprise. Latency will be much lower than `admin_logs`, but
            events will not be returned in chronological order and may
            contain duplicates.

          Limits the number of events returned

          Note: Sometimes, the events less than the limit requested can be returned
          even when there may be more events remaining. This is primarily done in
          the case where a number of events have already been retrieved and these
          retrieved events are returned rather than delaying for an unknown amount
          of time to see if there are any more results.

        Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling updates
        to the [event stream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).

        Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the
        server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive
        updated responses.

        Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for
        enterprise events.

        To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll
        URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.

        When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value
        `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as
        it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a
        request to the [events endpoint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) with the last known
        `stream_position`.

        After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now
        repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.

        If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will
        receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response
        you’ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.

        If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to
        make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response
        for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.

        Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the
        real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint
        first.

        Get a list of current file versions for a legal hold

        In some cases you may want to get previous file versions instead. In these
        cases, use the `GET  /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/file_versions_on_hold`
        API instead to return any previous versions of a file for this legal hold
        policy assignment.

        Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all file
        versions held for this policy ID. Instead, this API will only return the
        latest file version held in the newly developed architecture. The `GET
        /file_version_legal_holds` API can be used to fetch current and past versions
        of files held within the legacy architecture.

        The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used to
        find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.

        Get a list of previous file versions for a legal hold
        assignment.

        In some cases you may only need the latest file versions instead. In these
        cases, use the `GET  /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/files_on_hold` API
        instead to return any current (latest) versions of a file for this legal hold
        policy assignment.

        Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all files
        held for this policy ID. Instead, this API will only return past file versions
        held in the newly developed architecture. The `GET /file_version_legal_holds`
        API can be used to fetch current and past versions of files held within the
        legacy architecture.

        The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used to
        find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.

        Creates a request to download multiple files and folders as a single `zip`

        the checks to ensure that the user has access to all the items, and then
        returns a `download_url` and a `status_url` that can be used to download the
        archive.

        The limit for an archive is either the Account's upload limit or
        10,000 files, whichever is met first.

        **Note**: Downloading a large file can be
        affected by various
        factors such as distance, network latency,
        bandwidth, and congestion, as well as packet loss
        ratio and current server load.
        For these reasons we recommend that a maximum ZIP archive
        total size does not exceed 25GB.

            Returns an error if some of the parameters are missing or
            not valid.

            In most cases, this error might happen because the JSON request body is
            not valid JSON, any of the items has an incorrect or missing ID, any of
            the items is not a file or folder, or the root folder with ID `0` has been
            added to the list of folders to add to the archive.

            The following is a list of common error codes for this response.

            * `bad_request` - the request body is missing, invalid, or both the list
            of files and folders are empty. Additionally, it this error might be
            returned when attempting to add the root folder with ID `0` to an archive.
            * `zip_download_file_count_exceeded_limit` - the requested files and
            folders would result in an archive with more than 10,000 files. The
            request will have to be split into multiple requests to reduce the number
            of files per archive.
            * `zip_download_pre_compressed_bytes_exceeded_limit` - the requested files
            and folders would result in an archive with more than the allowed download
            limit. The request will have to be split into multiple requests to reduce
            the size of the archive.

          The unique identifier that represent a folder.

          The ID for any folder can be determined
          by visiting this folder in the web application
          and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
          for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/folder/123`
          the `folder_id` is `123`.

          The root folder of a Box account is
          always represented by the ID `0`.

              A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event
              that has been applied to this item.

              This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint
              to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
              identifier was read.

              An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
              would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
              user events for changes to the item. The application would
              ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
              is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
              fetched resource.

              This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint

              A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event
              that has been applied to this item.

              This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint
              to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
              identifier was read.

              An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
              would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
              user events for changes to the item. The application would
              ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
              is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
              fetched resource.

          description: |-
            The key of the template to filter search results by.

            In many cases the template key is automatically derived
            of its display name, for example `Contract Template` would
            become `contractTemplate`. In some cases the creator of the
            template will have provided its own template key.

            Please [list the templates for an enterprise][list], or
            get all instances on a [file][file] or [folder][folder]
            to inspect a template's key.

            Setting this will also prevent Box admins from editing

            By default, this endpoint returns only the most basic info about the items for
            which the query matches. This attribute can be used to specify a list of
            additional attributes to return for any item, including its metadata.

            This attribute takes a list of item fields, metadata template identifiers,
            or metadata template field identifiers.

            For example:

            * `created_by` will add the details of the user who created the item to
            the response.
            * `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>` will return the mini-representation
            of the metadata instance identified by the `scope` and `templateKey`.
            * `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>.<field>` will return all the mini-representation
            of the metadata instance identified by the `scope` and `templateKey` plus
            the field specified by the `field` name. Multiple fields for the same
            `scope` and `templateKey` can be defined.

              levels can only be accessed by appropriately authenticated Box users.

              endpoint with the `fields` query parameter to get
              the metadata by ID.

              To request a metadata instance for a particular `scope` and `templateKey`
              use the following format for the `fields` parameter:
              `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>`

              For example, `?fields=metadata.enterprise_27335.marketingCollateral`.

              An object containing the metadata instances that have been
              attached to this file.

              Each metadata instance is uniquely identified by its `scope` and
              `templateKey`. There can only be one instance of any metadata
              template attached to each file. Each metadata instance is nested
              within an object with the `templateKey` as the key, which again
              itself is nested in an object with the `scope` as the key.

                            This URL is a template and will require the `{+asset_path}` to
                            be replaced by a path. In general, for unpaged representations
                            it can be replaced by an empty string.

                            For paged representations, replace the `{+asset_path}` with the
                            page to request plus the extension for the file, for example
                            `1.pdf`.

                            When requesting the download URL the following additional
                            query params can be passed along.

                            * `set_content_disposition_type` - Sets the
                            `Content-Disposition` header in the API response with the
                            specified disposition type of either `inline` or `attachment`.
                            If not supplied, the `Content-Disposition` header is not
                            included in the response.

                            * `set_content_disposition_filename` - Allows the application to
                              define the representation's file name used in the
                              `Content-Disposition` header.  If not defined, the filename
                              is derived from the source file name in Box combined with the
                              extension of the representation.

              A list of metadata instances, nested within key-value pairs of their `scope`
              and `templateKey`.

              To access the metadata for a file or folder, first use the
              metadata endpoints to determine the metadata templates available to your
              enterprise.

              Then use the `GET /files/:id` or `GET /folder/:id`
              endpoint with the `fields` query parameter to get
              the metadata by ID.

              To request a metadata instance for a particular `scope` and `templateKey`
              use the following format for the `fields` parameter:
              `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>`

              For example, `?fields=metadata.enterprise_27335.marketingCollateral`.

              A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event
              that has been applied to this item.

              This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint
              to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
              identifier was read.

              An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
              would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
              user events for changes to the item. The application would
              ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
              is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
              fetched resource.
